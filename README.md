# Oil_price_prediction_analysis


Explanation of Each Step:
Imports: Import necessary libraries for data handling, visualization, and machine learning.

Load the Data: Load the historical oil prices dataset from an open source. Here, we're using Brent Crude Oil prices.

Data Preprocessing: Convert the date column to a datetime format and set it as the index. This makes it easier to work with time series data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the historical oil prices and their distribution using matplotlib and seaborn.

Feature Engineering: Create lag features to help the model learn from past data. For instance, use the previous day's price as a feature to predict the current day's price.

Prepare Data for Machine Learning: Split the data into training and testing sets.

Train a Linear Regression Model: Train a simple linear regression model using the lagged prices as features.

Evaluate the Model: Calculate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2) to evaluate the model's performance.

Plot the Results: Visualize the actual vs. predicted oil prices to see how well the model performs.

Running the Notebook:
Copy the above script into a Jupyter notebook cell.
Run each cell step-by-step to see the outputs, graphs, and results of the linear regression model.
Customization:
Dataset: You can replace the dataset URL with other open datasets related to oil or energy.
Modeling: Try different machine learning models like Decision Trees or Neural Networks to see if you can improve the prediction accuracy.
Visualization: Add more complex visualizations, such as correlation heatmaps or moving averages, to gain deeper insights.
